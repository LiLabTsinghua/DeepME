# Cell factory design integrating knowledge graphs with deep learning
This repo contains a PyTorch implementation for DeepME, which is model proposed in our paper **"Cell factory design integrating knowledge graphs with deep learning"**.


## Brief Introduction
Deep Learning for Metabolic Engineering (DeepME) is a novel data-driven framework that **integrates metabolic and functional knowledge graphs with deep representation learning** to systematically predict genome-wide engineering targets. DeepME captures system-level gene-metabolite associations, achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in identifying metabolic genes with improved capacity to discover distal targets, generalizes to non-metabolic and heterologous genes with greater engineering potential, and supports zero- and few-shot learning via transfer learning.

## How to use DeepME
```
# To make target prediction using trained DeepME using dataset, please run the following script
python script/pred.py
```
```
# To funetune trained DeepME, please run the following script
python script/finetune_tpn.py
```

```
# To train new DeepME from scarch, please run the following script
python script/train_kge.py # knowledge graph embedding
#python script/pretrain_tpn.py # if data augmentation strategy is used
python script/train_tpn.py # training target prediction network
```
1.Modify the hyperparameters in the relevant files as needed.


## How to evaluate DeepME
```
# To benchmark embedding, please run the following script
python script/embedding_benchmark.py
```
```
# To evaluate trained DeepME based on curacted dataset, please run the following script
python script/test_tpn.py
```
1.If any new dataset is used for evaluation, please place the file in the data/me_data/new_folder/ directory (ensure the format is consistent with existing files). Then, add the corresponding entry in load_file_path() in code/utils.py.
2.Modify the hyperparameters in the relevant files as needed.

## Reproduce
```
# To reproduce external dataset ECO_2023_metabolic, please run the following script:
python script/test_tpn.py
```
